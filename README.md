# hiwxbot
twitter bot for accessing metar data from the NWS

there's really not much here
getMetar - this is a python script that grabs metars from the NWS in XML, parses them into Metar objects for use elsewhere
checkForBadWx - looks at a bunch of metars and sends tweets if there is bad weather
synopsis - this fires an hourly synopsis of weather
